# ðŸš— Easy Carros - FIAP Project

## Overview

This project is part of a coursework for the Analysis and Systems Development program at FIAP University. The goal of this project was to challenge students to innovate in the car rental market for the company BRQ Digital Solutions. My idea was to create software that serves as an intermediary platform connecting car renters and vehicle owners.
